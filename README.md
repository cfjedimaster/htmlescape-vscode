This is a Visual Studio Code extension that simply converts any text into web-ready text that can be used in a blog entry. So for example, a `<` character will become `&lt;`. There are two uses of it:

### Open in Preview Document

To use, simply open a file and run `Show Escaped HTML`. If no text is selected, it will convert the entire document. The result is opened in a preview document to the side:

![Example](images/preview.gif)

### Replace in Document

To use this feature, you must have selected text (I'm open to changing this). Select text, run `Replace Selection with Escaped HTML` and the current selection will be escaped in the document itself.

# Updates

0.0.6 Significant update by Oleg Karasik again! Please see the details here <https://github.com/cfjedimaster/htmlescape-vscode/pull/2>.

0.0.5 Merge PR by Oleg Karasik (https://github.com/cfjedimaster/htmlescape-vscode/pull/1)

0.0.4 I switched the code to copy/mimic this MS example (https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/master/previewhtml-sample) and it seems to have fixed the copy/paste issue. One problem I have now though is that I can't get the textarea to be 100% big. I had to pick a size and just hope it works out ok. I also don't honestly know what a few lines of this code does. :)

0.0.3 I switched the display to use a textarea. This makes it - hopefully - a bit easier to get the code. It also helps preserve tabs. Unfortunately, you can't CTRL+A in the textarea. Not sure why.
